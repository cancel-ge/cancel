# Contributing to Cancel.ge 🎉
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- 🐛 Reporting a bug

- 🔧 Submitting a fix
- 🚀 Proposing new features
- 👨‍💻 Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github 💻
We use GitHub to host code, track issues, and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests 🔄
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. 🍴 Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. ✅ If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. 📝 If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. ⚙️ Ensure the test suite passes.
5. 📏 Make sure your code lints.
6. 📨 Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License 📜
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/cancel-ge/cancel/issues) 🐞
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/cancel-ge/cancel/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code 📝
[This is an official GitHub guide]([http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/creating-an-issue)) for reporting a bug and we think it's not a bad model.
**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- 🔍 A quick summary and/or background
- 🧑‍💻 Steps to reproduce (Please be specific!)
- 🤔 What you expected would happen
- ❗ What actually happens
- 📝 Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding. 🙌
